    <H1> Hermione Granger</H1>
    <p>Fellow best friend of Harry Potter, Hermione is the brains of the trio. Her wand is 10 3/4ths 
        inches long, made of vinewood, and possesses a dragon heartstring core. Dragon heartstring is
         material obtained from a dragon that is often used in the cores of Harry Potter character 
         wands, though it is relatively unknown what parts of the dragon are used â€” although it might
          be the dragon's heart that produces the aptly named "heartstring." Dragon wands will always 
          bond strongly with their current owner.
       <br> Dragon heartstring produces the most powerful wands, and Hermione's is no exception.
         At the young age of 15, Hermione is able to produce a corporeal Patronus, which is a very
          advanced piece of magic and is a credit to the talents of both herself and her wand.
           For a time, Hermione uses the stolen wand of Bellatrix Lestrange after Hermione's is 
           confiscated, but she's far from happy about it</p>
